        <h2 class="section-header">Northeastern Coastal Areas Online Meetup</h2>
        <p>On July 18th, 2020, both our team and Jiangnan_China hosted a regional meetup ’Northeastern Coastal Areas Online Meetup’. Total 15 teams participated in the meeting and 8 of them gave presentations about their projects. During discussion, other teams’ practical advice inspired us to improve our project. After the meetup, we also helped many teams for further cooperation. Moreover, we were so honored to invite one of iGEM Human Practices Committee Member Nan Zhang to give us valuable suggestions about the new rules. Finally we analyzed the changes of prize criteria and the event was satisfactorily concluded.Click here for details</p>

<h2 class="section-header" id="2">The Conference of China iGEMer Community (CCiC)</h2>
<p>
  This years, From August 29th to August 31st  2020, our team, Jilin_China, took part in the 7th CCiC (Conference of China iGEMer Community) whose theme was 'from LAB to FAB (industrialization)'. All of our Teammates attended the meeting and there are 48 teams in total that joined in CCiC 2020. During CCiC, we received insightful suggestions from the judges after exhibiting the design and experiment of our project. Throughout the four-day communication, we got plenty of excellent inspirations which encouraged us to discover some potential new applications. Additionally, we also had a creditable discussion during poster exhibition.

Figure 2. TAG lipase deletions result in greatly increased lipid accumulation in LDs. (A, B) Plots showing the mean Nile red fluorescence intensities in single cells from indicated strains. The samples were analyzed at 24 hour time point (A) and 72 hour time point (B). The bars show median and its 95% confidence intervals. ****, **, *, and ns note p-values <0.0001, <0.01, <0.05, and >0.05, respectively, of pair-wise comparisons with wild-type using Mann-Whitney U test.

  <p>In our light control system, E.coli (ΔenvZ) was required because of the property of  the protein. UCAS-China provides us with a special type of E. coli (ΔenvZ）.It was a great help to our experiment. </p>

  <p>
    After iGEM 2019, we have established collaborations with QHFZ-China. Meanwhile, during the whole year of iGEM 2020, we also collaborated with them and had mutual benefit on each other.We considered our works with QHFZ-China as our Partnership this year.For the details of our constant activities and works in the annual year.Click here to visit our Partnership Page</p>
