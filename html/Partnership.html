        <h2 class="section-header">Overview</h2>
        <p>Due to COVID-19, our brainstorm was carried out online. We and QHFZ-China exchanged ideas through WeChat to help each other determine and design the project. At the same time, we also discussed how to carry out iGEM activities during the pandemic, for instance, questionnaire distribution and online interviews.</p>

The lipid accumulation was also measured at 72 hours following dilution. In this time point, the culture had reached the stationary phase, and LDs were clearly detectable with Nile red staining for all tested strains, including the wild-type (Fig 2B). Lipid accumulation is known to increase in <i> S. cerevisiae cells </i> upon nutrient depletion (Werner-Washburne et al., 1993), and our results reveal that the difference between wild-type and TAG lipase deletion strains is considerably reduced in the stationary phase cells (Fig 2B). In the 72-hour time point, we did not observe a statistically significant difference between wild-type and the single <i> tgl4Δ </i>  or double <i> tgl3Δ tgl4Δ </i> deletion cells. Single deletion of <i>TGL3</i>, which had the largest effect in the 24-hour time point, also led to increased LD staining intensity at 72 hours. We observed the highest intracellular lipid levels with the triple <i> tgl3Δ tgl4Δ tgl5Δ </i> deletion strain, and interestingly, in this time point, the <i> zwf1Δ </i> strain had considerably lower LD staining, comparable to the level of the wild-type strain (Fig 2B). Although the lipid levels of <i> zwf1Δ </i> strain were not lower in the 24-hour time point, <i> ZWF1 </i> deletion could be expected to result in decreased lipid synthesis, as Zwf1 is required to regenerate NADPH, a critical cofactor in fatty acid synthesis. Taken together, by preventing TAG degradation with triple deletion of TAG lipases, we have achieved a considerable increase in lipid production compared to the wild-type strain.

  <h2 class="section-header">Details</h2>
  <p>At the beginning of June, we had a mini-conversation. QHFZ-China learned that Jilin_China’s questionnaire was mainly for college students and they suggested that students of all ages should participate in it, so they helped to promote our questionnaires to a wider range of people. </p>

    In late June, we learned that QHFZ-China’s project is related to protein structure, which required TDP protein structure to predict its function. They turned to us for help, and we introduced 2014 Jilin_China team member Guangyuan Song, a doctor in structural biology with rich experience in protein structure, as their consultant. </p>

  <h2 class="section-header">Summary</h2>
  <p>In early October, QHFZ-China completed some of its results, demonstrating that bacteria can be stored and recovered through lyophilization. But when they cooperated with other teams, some of them were unable to recover their bacteria, so they doubted the method of lyophilization. Therefore, they wanted us to help them verify the feasibility of their method, namely whether the freeze-dried bacteria could recover after transportation and preservation, so we helped QHFZ-China verify the freeze-dried effect of their bacteria and succeeded. This proved the feasibility of their method. At the same time, they were sending the bacteria to us at room temperature, which proved their engineering success: transport the engineered bacteria without refrigerator. </p>
